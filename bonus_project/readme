We've developed a straightforward method to detect satellites using machine learning, trained on a diverse dataset of over 40,000 images. These images cover a broad spectrum of conditionsâ€”different lighting, angles, and settings where satellites appear alongside other objects. The aim was to teach our models to pinpoint satellites accurately, regardless of the surrounding distractions.

We used Keras for its simplicity and efficiency in building and iterating deep learning models. After experimenting with various configurations, we ended up with models that are pretty good at identifying satellites in images. They can tell a satellite apart from stars, space debris, or anything else floating around in space, without needing to isolate the satellite visually from its background.
